Title: Synesthetic Harmony

Introduction:
Immerse yourself in a world of synesthesia where music and colors blend into a harmonious ensemble. Our program invites you to experience the stunning connection between visual impressions and musical art.

Concept:
Our program utilizes advanced technologies to create synesthesia between images and music. We extract a series of frames from a video and analyze each image to determine its dominant color. These colors are then transformed into harmonic melodies played by different instruments.

Musical Performance:
We present three instruments, each inspired by the dominant color of an image: guitar, violin, and piano. Each instrument plays a melody influenced by the intensity and color composition of the image. The combination of these melodies creates a unique musical experience that captures the visual impressions of the video and transforms them into an acoustic journey.

Visual Presentation:
While the music plays, we present you with the original video that serves as the basis for the musical interpretation. Immerse yourself in the visual representation and let yourself be enchanted by the symbiosis of image and sound.

Conclusion:
Experience the magic of synesthesia with our program that blurs the boundaries between the senses. Let yourself be carried away by the melodious harmonies and vibrant colors into a world full of emotions and creativity. Welcome to a unique artistic experience â€“ Synesthetic Harmony.
